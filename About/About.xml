  <description>1.3.0.1 (03-14-2020)

Adds new types and sizes of doors to RimWorld and an extensible framework for other mods to add such doors.

Currently included:
* Doors (1x2) - Double sized doors.
* Doors (1x3) - Triple sized doors.
* Curtains (Tribal) - Fragile, flammable, and made of fabric, these curtains provide fast movement through buildings.
* Jail Door - Stronger door to keep prisoners inside.
* Gates - Stylized doors perfect for meeting pre-industrial needs.
* Remote Doors - Garage-style doors that can be opened by remote buttons or levers.
* Blast Doors - Incredibly large and secure doors used to keep greater threats at bay.

Commissioned by CMDR Toss Antilles.

========================
A 1.1 compatible version of Doors Expanded, rewritten and recreated by lbmaian to be even better than before.

1.22.1.2 (03-06-2020)
========================

1.22.1.1 (03-04-2020)
========================

1.22.1.0 (02-29-2020)
========================
Balance pass based on ~b18~r1.1 changes and consistency. Engineered by lbmaian.
- All doors (except blast doors and curtains) MaxHitPoints were reduced, typically by about a quarter to match the B19 change to vanilla doors.
- All doors (except curtains) Mass have reduced, with the assumption that vanilla doors have 20 mass (only relevant if a mod like MinifyEverything is installed).
- Related 1-wide vs 2-wide vs 3-wide door stats and costs have been rescaled for consistency.
- Blast doors have same terrain affordance as walls, and same construction skill requirement as autodoors.
- Prisoner containment research requires medieval tech level.
- Blast door research requires hi-tech research bench.
Also add dependency to the Harmony mod.

1.22.0.0 (02-28-2020)
========================
RimWorld 1.1 compatibility (RimWorld 1.0 still works). Engineered by lbmaian.
No longer requires JecsTools in either RimWorld 1.0 or 1.1.
Also revamp door remote button/lever job so that it consistently respects whether door remote button/lever is enabled throughout the job, and fixes related pathing issues.

1.21.0.0 (01-31-2020)
========================
Rewrite and fully rebase code onto 1.0 RimWorld, fixing several bugs. Engineered by lbmaian.
- fixes pathing issues, including enemies warping through large doors
- forbid/unforbid has immediate effect (instead of having to wait a tick)
- fixes behavior inconsistent with vanilla doors, including default door opening/closing speeds, previously held open door closing behavior, whether enemies set fire to doors, heat transfer rates through open/closed doors
- allow &lt;1.0 fillPercent doors with correct cover/snow/etc. calculations
- doors are non-minifiable (non-uninstallable) by default
- doors block light by default
- door opening speed stat now appears in door expanded doors' info dialog (note: def.doorOpenSpeedRate value currently isn't reflected in this)
- remote doors default to non-remotely secured
- remote hold open state now linked to remote button/lever, with latter's state initialized to first linked remote door
- remote hold open state no longer clobbers native hold open state (in case door is unlinked)
- secured remotely doors ignore native hold open state (and disables hold open gizmo)
- custom remote door gizmos now appear right after hold open gizmo
- more consistent messages on button connect/disconnect
- remote button/lever no longer appears above pawns
- fixed Stretch and StretchVertical and non-2-width DoubleSwing door type animations
- Stretch/StretchVertical defs have new custom parameters, with the only functional difference between Stretch and StretchVertical being defaults
- ghost (pre-placement) and blueprint door graphics now always match actual door graphics
- ghost graphics for def.rotatesSouth=false now skip south rotation, and fix subtle bugs when spawning def.rotatesSouth=false doors
- ghost graphics now appear above existing buildings as in vanilla
- 1x1 non-manually-rotatable doors, including blueprints, auto-rotate like vanilla doors (and all such 1x1 doors in this mod are updated accordingly)
- dev mode inspector has new toggles (write temperature, write edifice grid, write doors), more path info, more precise mouse position, and patch call registry for debugging
