  <description><![CDATA[1.22.1.2 (06-03-2020)

Adds new types and sizes of doors to RimWorld and an extensible framework for other mods to add such doors.

Currently included:
* Doors (1x2) - Double sized doors.
* Doors (1x3) - Triple sized doors.
* Curtains (Tribal) - Fragile, flammable, and made of fabric, these curtains provide fast movement through buildings.
* Jail Door - Stronger door to keep prisoners inside.
* Gates - Stylized doors perfect for meeting pre-industrial needs.
* Remote Doors - Garage-style doors that can be opened by remote buttons or levers.
* Blast Doors - Incredibly large and secure doors used to keep greater threats at bay.

Commissioned by CMDR Toss Antilles.

========================
Changelog
========================
1.22.1.2 (06-03-2020)
========================
Fix potential NRE and room unfogging in edge cases involving large doors, and fix more potential subtle issues related to Fillage. Engineered by lbmaian.
Scale WorkToBuild linearly like most of vanilla, rebalance thick gate and blast door costs

1.22.1.1 (04-03-2020)
========================
Backport tweaks and fixes to RimWorld 1.0 version. From this point forward, the RimWorld 1.0 version is in feature freeze. Engineered by lbmaian.
"JT_PlaceWorker_OnTopOfWalls" is now translated if JecsTools isn't loaded.

1.22.1.0 (29-02-2020)
========================
Balance pass based on ~b18~r1.1 changes and consistency. Engineered by lbmaian.
- All doors (except blast doors and curtains) MaxHitPoints were reduced, typically by about a quarter to match the B19 change to vanilla doors.
- All doors (except curtains) Mass have reduced, with the assumption that vanilla doors have 20 mass (only relevant if a mod like MinifyEverything is installed).
- Related 1-wide vs 2-wide vs 3-wide door stats and costs have been rescaled for consistency.
- Blast doors have same terrain affordance as walls, and same construction skill requirement as autodoors.
- Prisoner containment research requires medieval tech level.
- Blast door research requires hi-tech research bench.
Also add dependency to the Harmony mod.

1.22.0.0 (28-02-2020)
========================
RimWorld 1.1 compatibility (RimWorld 1.0 still works, but in feature freeze). Engineered by lbmaian.
No longer requires JecsTools in either RimWorld 1.0 or 1.1.
Also revamp door remote button/lever job so that it consistently respects whether door remote button/lever is enabled throughout the job, and fixes related pathing issues.

1.21.0.0 (01-31-2020)
========================
Rewrite and fully rebase code onto 1.0 RimWorld, fixing several bugs. Engineered by lbmaian.
- fixes pathing issues, including enemies warping through large doors
- forbid/unforbid has immediate effect (instead of having to wait a tick)
- fixes behavior inconsistent with vanilla doors, including default door opening/closing speeds, previously held open door closing behavior, whether enemies set fire to doors, heat transfer rates through open/closed doors
- allow <1.0 fillPercent doors with correct cover/snow/etc. calculations
- doors are non-minifiable (non-uninstallable) by default
- doors block light by default
- door opening speed stat now appears in door expanded doors' info dialog (note: def.doorOpenSpeedRate value currently isn't reflected in this)
- remote doors default to non-remotely secured
- remote hold open state now linked to remote button/lever, with latter's state initialized to first linked remote door
- remote hold open state no longer clobbers native hold open state (in case door is unlinked)
- secured remotely doors ignore native hold open state (and disables hold open gizmo)
- custom remote door gizmos now appear right after hold open gizmo
- more consistent messages on button connect/disconnect
- remote button/lever no longer appears above pawns
- fixed Stretch and StretchVertical and non-2-width DoubleSwing door type animations
- Stretch/StretchVertical defs have new custom parameters, with the only functional difference between Stretch and StretchVertical being defaults
- ghost (pre-placement) and blueprint door graphics now always match actual door graphics
- ghost graphics for def.rotatesSouth=false now skip south rotation, and fix subtle bugs when spawning def.rotatesSouth=false doors
- ghost graphics now appear above existing buildings as in vanilla
- 1x1 non-manually-rotatable doors, including blueprints, auto-rotate like vanilla doors (and all such 1x1 doors in this mod are updated accordingly)
- dev mode inspector has new toggles (write temperature, write edifice grid, write doors), more path info, more precise mouse position, and patch call registry for debugging
