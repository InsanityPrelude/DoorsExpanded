  <!--
  Although doors, including our custom doors, aren't uninstallable (minifiable) by default,
  we're defining masses for custom doors, so we might as well define a default for all doors if another mod hasn't already defined one yet.
  This way, if another mod like MinifyEverything does make doors uninstallable, they'll have a reasonable mass.
